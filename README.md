## Introduction

Morphological erosion is an important function in image processing and is widely used in computer vision. In this procedure, morphological erosion lowers the boundaries of an object occurring in an image with the support of a structuring element or kernel. Applications include filtering smaller noise, outlining next to objects, and smoothing the contours of images. This article explains the mathematical equations required to compute results for applications involving different erosion scenarios. For instance, in your research paper entitled "Eroding Pokémon Image," the inquiry pertains to how morphological erosion can illustrate the impact of varying kernel sizes on the distinctive representation of images of Pokémon. When one employs erosion, it becomes apparent, visually, that there is a loss of various edges, contours, and finer details as a result of an increase in kernel size. For a better appreciation, the study even describes how one may refine the erosion operation to have certain requirements such as noise removal, with emphasis placed on basic characteristics. Thus, this work merits attention for reasons of its practical usability. Many important applications of computer vision—preprocessing pipelines, object recognition, as well as image segmentation—rely on morphological transformations, including erosion. For example, erosion can play a very important role in eliminating small objects from binary images or in breaking connected objects. It is, therefore, crucial for the user to understand how the size of the kernel influences it to affect the image in these applications, lest they lose important features or fail to remove noise adequately. The use of the Kaggle Pokémon image dataset interestingly provides an adequately visual yet relevant context for studying the morphological erosion technique. This technique does well in providing the theoretical concepts involved and is also practically useful in processing images. Doing so also strengthens our insight into how kernel size affects transformations on images in such a way that practitioners and learners can tweak their computer vision workflows to enhance.
